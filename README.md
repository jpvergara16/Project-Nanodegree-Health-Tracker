# Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Project: Health Tracker
```
```
## Project Description:
- This project is for the Front-End Nanodegree Program by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). Using Backbone, I developed a single page app that tracks the user's calorie intake, and other health-related metrics.

## Project Criteria (Listed in CRITERIA.txt)
- Typing food names into the search field will display a list of matching foods as provided by the health API.
- Users will be able to select an item from the list, and the item will be added to the list of foods the user is tracking.
- The total calorie count will also update to reflect the new daily total.
- Additional info listed in Udacity's [Health Tracker Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/5030258562/rubric)
