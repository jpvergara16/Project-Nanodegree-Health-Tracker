Asynchronous Data Usage and Error Handling.
  All data APIs used in the project should load asynchronously and all errors should be handled gracefully.
  In case of error (e.g. in a situation where a third party api does not return the expected result) we expect your webpage to do one of the following:
  A message is displayed notifying the user that the data can't be loaded, OR There are no negative repercussions to the UI.
  Note: Please note that we expect students to handle errors if the browser has trouble initially reaching the 3rd-party site as well.
